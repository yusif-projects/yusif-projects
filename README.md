## About Me
I'm an **iOS Software Architect** from **Baku, Azerbaijan** 🇦🇿, leading the mobile development efforts for **[a quite popular app](https://apps.apple.com/az/app/id1602500636)** in my country.

I love working with **Swift** and as you can see tend to prefer **UIKit** over **SwiftUI**. 🤷🏻‍♂️

## About these Repositories
This GitHub is where I share my **pet projects**, things I tinker with for learning and enjoyment.  
Feel free to explore, but keep in mind these are purely **for fun**! 🎉
