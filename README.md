I'm an **iOS Software Architect** from **Baku, Azerbaijan**, leading the mobile development efforts for **[quite a popular app](https://apps.apple.com/az/app/id1602500636)** in my country.

I have more than 4 years of professional experience in working with **Swift** and as you can probably see in my code I tend to prefer **UIKit** over **SwiftUI**.

This GitHub is where I share my **pet projects**, things I tinker with for learning and enjoyment.  
Feel free to explore, but keep in mind these are purely **for fun**!
